# skin.mousetuary
Mousetuary is a Kodi skin, derived from the Kodi default skin "Estuary" (at 1.9.11 on the krypton branch of phil65/skin.estuary)
This is the "krypton" branch.

The aims of Mousetuary are: 
- to cater to PVR users better (little else has changed from Estuary, apart from mouse controls)
- to be a bit more mouse-friendly, for those who prefer to control a 10-foot HTPC interface with just a mouse
- to take UI cues from Windows Media Center 

There is an optional keymap to allow WMC-like scrolling in the EPG, and guide selection from live TV with ctrl-g. After installation, move wmc-keymap.xml and guidekey.py into the userdata/keymaps folder. (the rules for skins won't allow keymaps to be automatically installed)
